This project I made is for the demonstration of pipelines. I utilised Terraform Cloud provisioning infras on GCP, using Ansible to configure remote VM instances for initiation and deployment, Docker image as artifact for deployment and finally, a Jenkins server integrating webhook from GitHub and further CICD process.
